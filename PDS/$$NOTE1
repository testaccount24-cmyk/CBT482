Note from Sam Golob:
   John modified this code from what Eric Bielefeld submitted
   to the CBT Tape, and which was in File 482.  Problem was that
   if you had more than 100 GDGs, the program would go into a
   loop.  Now (with this modification) it won't go into a loop
   until you have 1000 GDGs in the concatenation, so that should
   give you enough room.  John's comments deal with what he could
   deduce, concerning the history and origins of this code.

Sam,

  Attached is my source code with revisions.  I used the existing
macros.  The earliest version I had of this code was one I had
brought along from previous lives several times.  It had November,
1977 at the top of the comments and had some revisions coded by
HMD (Howard M. Dean) in 08/81.  It did not support unlabeled tapes
and had all the macro code inline.  I also found here a source
deck that was closer to the CBT version which was last changed in
1985.  The thing I liked least about it was it required running
authorized which I could find no good reason for.  My address
