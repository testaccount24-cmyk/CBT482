//***FILE 482 is from Eric Bielefeld of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and   *   FILE 482
//*           contains a program called GDGCOPY to copy GDG files,  *   FILE 482
//*           in proper order, from one GDG to another.  The reason *   FILE 482
//*           for putting this program on the CBT Tape was because  *   FILE 482
//*           of a recent discussion thread on IBM-MAIN (circa      *   FILE 482
//*           end of August 2000) about copying GDG datasets in the *   FILE 482
//*           proper order.                                         *   FILE 482
